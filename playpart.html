    <h2>An Enemy of the People Act 3 by Henrik Ibsen</h2>

        <p class="speech">That is perfectly true! I see it comingâ€”I see it coming; we
        are on the threshold of a revolution! </p>

        <p class="direction">[A knock is heard at the door.]</p>

        <h5 class="name Hovstad">Hovstad.</h5> 
        <p class="speech">Hush!</p> 
        <p class="direction">[Calls out.]</p> 
        <p class="speech">Come in!</p> 
        <p class="direction">[DR. STOCKMANN comes in by the
            street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.]</p> 
        
        <p class="speech">Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?</p>

        <h5 class="name Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h5> 
        <p class="speech">You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!</p>

        <h5 class="name Hovstad">Hovstad.</h5> 
        <p class="speech">Has it come to that, then?</p>

        <h5 class="name Billing">Billing.</h5> 
        <p class="speech">Hurrah!</p>

        <h5 class="name Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h5> 
        <p class="speech">Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
            they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
            Mr. Billing!</p>

        <h5 class="name Billing">Billing.</h5> 
        <p class="speech">War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
            throats, Doctor!</p>

        <h5 class="name Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h5>
        <p class="speech">This article is only a beginning. I have already got
            four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?</p>

        <h5 class="name Billing">Billing</h5> 
        <p class="direction">[calls into the printing-room].</p> 
        
        <p class="speech">Aslaksen, just come here for a
            minute!</p>
