    <h1>Sai Srikar Miriyala - acts in a play</h1>
    <h2>An Enemy of the People Act 3 by Henrik Ibsen</h2>
    <p>
        <h6>Billing.</h6> 
        <p>That is perfectly true! I see it comingâ€”I see it coming; we
    are on the threshold of a revolution! </p>

    <p>[A knock is heard at the door.]</p>

    <h6>Hovstad.</h6> 
    <p>Hush!</p> 
    <p>[Calls out.]</p> 
    <p>Come in!</p> 
    <p>[DR. STOCKMANN comes in by the
        street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.]</p> 
    
    <p>Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?</p>

    <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6> 
    <p>You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!</p>

    <h6>Hovstad.</h6> 
    <p>Has it come to that, then?</p>

    <h6>Billing.</h6> 
    <p>Hurrah!</p>

    <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6> 
    <p>Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
        they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
        Mr. Billing!</p>

    <h6>Billing.</h6> 
    <p>War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
        throats, Doctor!</p>

    <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p>This article is only a beginning. I have already got
        four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?</p>

    <h6>Billing</h6> 
    <p>(calls into the printing-room).</p> 
    
    <p>Aslaksen, just come here for a
        minute!</p>
