    <h2>An Enemy of the People Act 3 by Henrik Ibsen</h2>

        Billing. That is perfectly true! I see it coming—I see it coming; we
    are on the threshold of a revolution!

    (A knock is heard at the door.)

    Hovstad. Hush! (Calls out.) Come in! (DR. STOCKMANN comes in by the
    street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.) Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?

    Dr. Stockmann. You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!

    Hovstad. Has it come to that, then?

    Billing. Hurrah!

    Dr. Stockmann. Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
    they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
    Mr. Billing!

    Billing. War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
    throats, Doctor!

    Dr. Stockmann. This article is only a beginning. I have already got
    four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?

    Billing (calls into the printing-room). Aslaksen, just come here for a
    minute!

    Hovstad. Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?

    Dr. Stockmann. No—far from it, my dear fellow. No, they are about
    quite another matter. But they all spring from the question of the
    water supply and the drainage. One thing leads to another, you know. It
    is like beginning to pull down an old house, exactly.

    Billing. Upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you
    have pulled all the old rubbish down.

    Aslaksen (coming in). Pulled down? You are not thinking of pulling down
    the Baths surely, Doctor?

    Hovstad. Far from it, don't be afraid.
